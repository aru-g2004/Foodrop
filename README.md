Here is the repo for an app that I developed for the Congressional App Challenge 2022, a national mobile application development challenge! It is an app that brings communities together to volunteer, reduce food waste, and feed our neighbors in need! My team won the Congressional App Challenge from New Jersey and presented the application in the Capitol Hill building in April to members of Congress and the D.C. community as well as our very own Congresswoman Bonnie Watson Coleman.
